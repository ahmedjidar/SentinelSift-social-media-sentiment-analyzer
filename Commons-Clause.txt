The “Commons Clause” is an additional restriction to the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Without limiting other terms in the License, the grant of rights under Sections 1 through 8 of the License
is expressly made subject to the following condition:

The Software may not be sold, sublicensed, or otherwise provided to third parties for a fee
if the value of the Software to the third party derives, entirely or substantially, from the functionality of the Software.

“Sell” means practicing any or all of the rights granted to you under the License to provide to third parties,
for a fee or other consideration (including distributing, sublicensing, renting, or leasing).
